rules: Mephit's Enthusiasm deals 4 damage to target creature or planeswalker. If excess
  damage was dealt this way, you get a boon with "When you cast your next creature
  spell, it perpetually gets +X/+0, where X is the amount of excess damage dealt this
  way." *(Perpetual effects that are given to cards are permanent regardless of what
  zone those cards are in and what zone they move to.)*
