  \ day or night, this game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells\
  \ during their own turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during\
  \ the untap step. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform\
  \ into their nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter\
  \ the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming\
