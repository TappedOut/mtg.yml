rules: "Enchant creature card in a graveyard\r\n\r\nWhen Dance of the Dead enters\
  \ the battlefield, if it's in play, it loses \"enchant creature card in a graveyard\"\
  \ and gains \"enchant creature put into play with Dance of the Dead.\" Return enchanted\
  \ creature card to play tapped under your control and attach Dance of the Dead to\
  \ it. When Dance of the Dead leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller\
  \ sacrifices it.\r\n\r\nEnchanted creature gets +1/+1 and doesn't untap during its\
  \ controller's untap step. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's\
  \ controller, that player may pay (1)(Black). If he or she does, untap that creature."
