rules: When this enters the battlefield, you may exile a creature card from your hand.
  If you do, search your hand and library for any number of cards with the same name,
  exile them, then shuffle your library. Then choose a creature card you own from
  outside the game. Conjure a duplicate of that card into your hand for each card
  exiled from your hand this way. *(Generate a copy of the chosen card that is not
  a token and put it into your hand.)*
