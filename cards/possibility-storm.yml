rules: Whenever a player casts a spell from his or her hand, that player exiles it,
  then exiles cards from the top of his or her library until he or she exiles a card
  that shares a card type with it. That player may cast that card without paying its
  mana cost. Then he or she puts all cards exiled with Possibility Storm on the bottom
  of his or her library in a random order.
