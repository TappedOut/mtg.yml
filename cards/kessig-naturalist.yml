  \ enters the battlefield, if it's not day or night, this game becomes day for all\
  \ players. If a player casts no spells during their own turn, this game becomes\
  \ night for all players next turn during the untap step. When it becomes night,\
  \ all permanents on the battlefield transform into their nightbound side if they\
  \ have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their\
  \ nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and\
