  \ must target a different player.\r\n\r\n- Target player discards all the cards\
  \ in their hand, then seeks that many nonland cards. *(Grab a random card of the\
  \ given criteria from your library and put it into your hand. Do not actually look\
  \ at your library nor shuffle it.)*\r\n- Chaos Balor deals 2 damage to target player\
  \ and they creature two Treasure tokens.\r\n- Chaos Balor deals 2 damage to each\
  \ creature target player controls. Those creatures perpetually get +2/+0. *(Perpetual\
  \ effects that are given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards\
  \ are in and what zone they move to.)*"
