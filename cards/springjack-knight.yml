rules: Whenever Springjack Knight attacks, clash with an opponent. If you win, target
  creature gains double strike until end of turn. (Each clashing player reveals the
  top card of his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player
  wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
