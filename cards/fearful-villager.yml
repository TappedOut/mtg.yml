  Daybound *(When this enters the battlefield, if it's not day or night, this game\
  \ becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during their own turn,\
  \ this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step. When\
  \ it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their nightbound\
  \ side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will\
  \ enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use\
  \ the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
