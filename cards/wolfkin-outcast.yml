rules: "This spell costs [[symbol:2]] less to cast if you control a Wolf or Werewolf.\r\
  \n\r\nDaybound *(When this enters the battlefield, if it's not day or night, this\
  \ game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during their own\
  \ turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step\
  \ next turn. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform\
  \ into their nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter\
  \ the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming\
  \ day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
