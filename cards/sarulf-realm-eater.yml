rules: "Whenever a permanent an opponent controls is put into a graveyard from the\
  \ battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on Sarulf, Realm Eater.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning\
  \ of your upkeep, if Sarulf has one or more +1/+1 counters on it, you may remove\
  \ all of them. If you do, exile each other nonland permanent with converted mana\
  \ cost less than or equal to the number of counters removed this way."
