rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhenever this deals combat damage to a player, that player exiles\
  \ cards from the top of their library until they exile an instant or sorcery card.\
  \ You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then that player puts the\
  \ exiled cards that weren't cast this way on the bottom of their library in a random\
  \ order."
