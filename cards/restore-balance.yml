  \ counters. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last\
  \ is removed, cast this without paying this card's mana cost.)*\r\n\r\nEach player\
  \ chooses a number of lands they control equal to the number of lands controlled\
  \ by the player who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players sacrifice\
