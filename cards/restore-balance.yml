rules: "Restore Balance is white.\r\n\r\nSuspend 6&mdash;[[symbol:W]] *(Rather than\
  \ cast this card from your hand, pay [[symbol:W]] and exile it with three time counters\
  \ on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is\
  \ removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)*\r\n\r\nEach player chooses a\
  \ number of lands they control equal to the number of lands controlled by the player\
  \ who controls the fewest, then sacrifices the rest. Players sacrifice creatures\
  \ and discard cards the same way."
