  \ or night, this game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during\

  \ step. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform into\
  \ their nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the\
  \ battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night\
