rules: "Choose one. If you control a commander as you cast this spell, you may choose\
  \ both modes.\r\n\r\n- Until end of turn, any number of target lands you control\
  \ become 1/1 Elemental creatures with vigilance, indestructible and haste. They're\
  \ still lands.\r\n- Choose target creature you don't control. Each creature you\
  \ control deals damage equal to its power to that creature."
