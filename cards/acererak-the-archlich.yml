rules: "When this enters the battlefield, if you haven't completed the Tomb of Annihilation\
  \ dungeon, return this to its owner's hand and venture into the dungeon. *(If you\
  \ aren't venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from\
  \ outside the game, put it into the command zone and put a venture counter on the\
  \ first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you venture\
  \ into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the\
  \ next room downward of your choice and triggering all effects of that room. When\
  \ you have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon\
  \ from the game. You can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*\r\n\r\nWhen\
  \ this attacks, for each opponent, you create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token\
  \ unless that player sacrifices a creature."
