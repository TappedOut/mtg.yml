rules: "This can't be blocked as long as it's attacking alone.\r\n\r\nWhenever this\
  \ deals combat damage to a player, venture into the dungeon. *(If you aren't venturing\
  \ through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside the game,\
  \ put it into the command zone and put a venture counter on the first room of that\
  \ dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while\
  \ you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next room downward of your\
  \ choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you have resolved the effects\
  \ of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the game. You can only\
  \ venture through one dungeon at a time.)*"
