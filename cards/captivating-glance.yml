  \ you win, gain control of enchanted creature. Otherwise, that player gains control\
  \ of enchanted creature. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her\
  \ library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her\
  \ card had a higher converted mana cost.)"
