rules: "Deathtouch\r\n\r\nWhenever you activate an ability of an artifact or creature\
  \ that isn't a mana ability, if one or more permanents were sacrificed to activate\
  \ it, you may copy that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy. (Sacrificing\
  \ an artifact for mana to activate an ability doesn't count.)"
