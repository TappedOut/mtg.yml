rules: "Exile target spell, then roll a twenty sided die and add that spell's converted\
  \ mana cost/mana value. *(Remember that MTG spindowns are not well weight balanced,\
  \ so please roll a die that isn't an MTG spindown.)*\r\n\r\nIf you roll a 1-14 |\
  \ You may cast the exiled card for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend\
  \ mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast that spell.\r\n<br>If you roll\
  \ 15+ | You may cast the exiled card without paying its mana cost for as long as\
  \ it remains exiled."
