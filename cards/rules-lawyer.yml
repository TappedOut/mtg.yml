rules: State-based actions don't apply to you or other permanents you control. (You
  don't lose the game due to having 0 or less life or drawing from an empty library.
  Your creatures aren't destroyed due to damage or deathtouch and aren't put into
  a graveyard due to having 0 or less toughness. Your planeswalkers aren't put into
  a graveyard if they have 0 loyalty. You don't put a legendary permanent into a graveyard
  if you control two with the same name. Counters aren't removed from your permanents
  due to game rules. Permanents you control attached or combined illegally remain
  on the battlefield. For complete rules and regulations, see rule 704.)
