rules: Flying, banding *(Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack
  in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control
  are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage,
  not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)*
