      - Banding *(Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in
        a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control
        are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat
        damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked
        by or is blocking.)*
