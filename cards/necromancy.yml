rules: "You may cast Necromancy as though it had flash. If you cast it any time a\
  \ sorcery couldn't have been cast, the controller of the permanent it becomes sacrifices\
  \ it at the beginning of the next cleanup step.\r\n\r\nWhen Necromancy enters the\
  \ battlefield, if it's on the battlefield, it becomes an Aura with \"enchant creature\
  \ put onto the battlefield with Necromancy.\" Put target creature card from a graveyard\
  \ onto the battlefield under your control and attach Necromancy to it. When Necromancy\
  \ leaves the battlefield, that creature's controller sacrifices it."
