rules: Target creature you control deals damage equal to its power to target creature
  you don't control. Choose a creature card in your hand. It perpetually gets +X/+X,
  where X is the amount of excess damage dealt this way. *(That card permanently gets
  +X/+X regardless of what zone the card is in and what zone it moves to.)*
