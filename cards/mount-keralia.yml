rules: At the beginning of your end step, put a pressure counter on this plane. When
  you planeswalk away from this, this deals damage equal to the number of pressure
  counter on this plane to each creature and each planeswalker. Whenever you roll
  a Chaos Symbol, prevent all damage that planes named Mount Keralia would deal this
  game to permanents you control.
