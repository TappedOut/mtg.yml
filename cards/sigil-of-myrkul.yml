rules: At the beginning of combat on your turn, mill a card. When you do, if there
  are four or more creature cards in your graveyard, put a +1/+1 counter on target
  creature you control and it gains deathtouch until end of turn. *(To mill a card,
  put the top card of your library into your graveyard.)*
