rules: "Whenever Iron Mastiff attacks, roll a twenty sided die for each player being\
  \ attacked and ignore all but the highest roll. *(Remember that MTG spindowns are\
  \ not well weight balanced, so please roll a die that isn't an MTG spindown.)*\r\
  \n\r\nIf you roll a 1-9 | Iron Mastiff deals damage equal to its power to you.\r\
  \n<br>If you roll 10-19 | Iron Mastiff deals damage equal to its power to defending\
  \ player.\r\n<br>If you roll a 20 | Iron Mastiff deals damage equal to its power\
  \ to each opponent."
