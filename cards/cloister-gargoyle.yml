rules: "When this enters the battlefield, venture into the dungeon. *(If you aren't\
  \ venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside\
  \ the game, put it into the command zone and put a venture counter on the first\
  \ room of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you venture into\
  \ the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next\
  \ room downward of your choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you\
  \ have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon\
  \ from the game. You can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*\r\n\r\nAs\
  \ long as you've completed a dungeon, this gets +3/+0 and has flying."
