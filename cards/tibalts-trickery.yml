rules: Counter target spell. Choose 1, 2 or 3 at random. Its controller mills that
  many cards, then exiles cards from the top of their library until they exile a nonland
  card with a different name than that spell. They may cast that card without paying
  its mana cost. Then they put the exiled cards on the bottom of their library in
  a random order.
