rules: "As Lich enters the battlefield, you lose life equal to your life total.\r\n\
  \r\nYou don't lose the game for having 0 or less life.\r\n\r\nIf you would gain\
  \ life, draw that many cards instead.\r\n\r\nWhenever you're dealt damage, sacrifice\
  \ that many nontoken permanents. If you can't, you lose the game.\r\n\r\nWhen Lich\
  \ is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you lose the game."
