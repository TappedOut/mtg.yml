rules: For each player, choose a creature card in that player's graveyard. Put those
  cards onto the battlefield under your control. They're black Zombies in addition
  to their other colours and types and they gain decayed. *(A creature with decayed
  can't block. When it attacks, sacrifice it at the end of combat.)*
