rules: "Whenever Decorated Knight attacks, draw a card from your original deck if\
  \ it's outside the game.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Decorated Knight from\
  \ exile if you sent it on an adventure.)*\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<h3>Present Arms</h3>\r\
  \n<h4>Sorcery &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\r\nExchange your library with another deck\
  \ you own from outside the game. Shuffle your library.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You\
  \ may cast Present Arms for [[symbol:2]][[symbol:U]] from anywhere that you have\
  \ the permission to cast this, then exile it on an adventure instead of putting\
  \ it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Present Arms and put\
  \ it on the stack, this card is treated only as Decorated Knight in whatever zone\
  \ it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(Example scenarios for Decorated Knight| You may cast this\
  \ off of [[Melek, Izzet Paragon]]. You may not target this with [[Snapcaster Mage]].\
  \ [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]] increases the cost of this. [[Electrodominance]]\
  \ requires X=3. You may cast this from a cascade spell if the spell has a cost greater\
  \ than Decorated Knight's cost. If you cast a Present Arms that another player owns,\
  \ only you may cast the Decorated Knight that gets sent on an adventure, not the\
  \ owner.)*"
