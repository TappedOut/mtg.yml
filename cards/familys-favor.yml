rules: Whenever you attack, put a shield counter on target attacking creature. Until
  end of turn, it gains "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, remove
  a shield counter from it. If you do, draw a card." *(If a creature with a shield
  counter on it would be dealt damage or destroyed, remove a shield counter from it
  instead.)*
