  \ dungeon cards you own from outside the game, put it into the command zone and\
  \ put a venture counter on the first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room\
  \ trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command\
  \ zone, advance to the next room downward of your choice and triggering all effects\
  \ of that room. When you have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon,\
