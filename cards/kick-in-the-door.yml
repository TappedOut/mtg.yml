rules: Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature. That creature gains haste until end
  of turn and can't be blocked by Walls this turn. Venture into the dungeon. *(If
  you aren't venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own
  from outside the game, put it into the command zone and put a venture counter on
  the first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you venture
  into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next
  room downward of your choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you have
  resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the
  game. You can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*
