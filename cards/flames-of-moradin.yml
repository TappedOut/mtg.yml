  \ artifact destroyed this way into your hand. Those duplicates perpetually gain\
  \ \"You may pay [[symbol:R]] rather than pay this spell's mana cost\" and \"At the\
  \ beginning of your end step, sacrifice this artifact.\" *(Perpetual effects that\
  \ are given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards are in and\
  \ what zone they move to.)*"
