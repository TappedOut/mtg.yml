rules: Whenever you attack, up to one target attacking creature can't be blocked this
  turn. At the beginning of the next end step, return that creature to its owner's
  hand. If you do, a creature of your choice an opponent controls perpetually gets
  -1/-0. *(That card permanently gets X regardless of what zone the card is in and
  what zone it moves to.)*
