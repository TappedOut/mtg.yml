rules: "Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, this gets +1/+1 until end of\
  \ turn.\r\n\r\nDaybound *(When this enters the battlefield, if it's not day or night,\
  \ this game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during their\
  \ own turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step.\
  \ When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their\
  \ nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield\
  \ will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does\
  \ not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
