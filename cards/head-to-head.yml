rules: You and target opponent play Seven Questions about the top card of that player's
  library. (That player looks at the card, then you ask up to six yes-or-no questions
  about the card that he or she answers truthfully. You guess the card's name-that's
  question seven-and the player reveals the card.) If you win, prevent all damage
  that would be dealt this turn by a source of your choice.
