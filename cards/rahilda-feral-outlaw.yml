rules: "Double strike\r\n\r\nWhen Rahilda, Feral Outlaw deals combat damage to a player,\
  \ exile a nonland card from their library at random. During any turn you attacked\
  \ with a Wolf or Werewolf, you may cast that card and you may spend mana as though\
  \ it were mana of any colour to cast that spell.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player\
  \ casts two spells during their own turn, this game becomes day during the untap\
  \ step next turn. When it becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield transform\
  \ into their daybound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the\
  \ battlefield will enter on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night\
  \ does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
