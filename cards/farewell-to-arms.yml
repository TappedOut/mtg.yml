rules: "As Farewell to Arms enters the battlefield, choose a hand attached to an opponent's\
  \ arm.\r\n\r\nWhen the chosen hand isn't behind its owner's back, sacrifice Farewell\
  \ to Arms. If you do, that player discards his or her hand . . . of cards. (The\
  \ lawyers wouldn't let us do it the other way.)"
