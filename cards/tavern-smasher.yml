rules: Nightbound *(If a player casts two spells during their own turn, this game
  becomes day next turn during the untap step. When it becomes day, all permanents
  on the battlefield transform into their daybound side if they have one, and any
  new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their daybound side if they
  have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*
