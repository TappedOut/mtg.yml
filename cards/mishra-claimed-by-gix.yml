rules: Whenever you attack, each opponent loses X life and you gain X life, where
  X is the number of attacking creatures. If Mishra, Claimed by Gix and a creature
  named Phyrexian Dragon Engine are attacking, and you both own and control them,
  exile them, then meld them into Mishra, Lost to Phyrexia. It enters the battlefield
  tapped and attacking.
