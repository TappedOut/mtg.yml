  \nWhenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, venture\
  \ into the dungeon. *(If you aren't venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the\
  \ dungeon cards you own from outside the game, put it into the command zone and\
  \ put a venture counter on the first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room\
  \ trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command\
  \ zone, advance to the next room downward of your choice and triggering all effects\
  \ of that room. When you have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon,\
  \ remove that dungeon from the game. You can only venture through one dungeon at\
  \ a time.)*"
