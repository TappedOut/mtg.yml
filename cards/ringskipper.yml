rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhen Ringskipper is put into a graveyard from play, clash with\
  \ an opponent. If you win, return Ringskipper to its owner's hand. (Each clashing\
  \ player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card on the\
  \ top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)"
