    flavour_text: "The Great hart stood like a statue, its hide painted gold by the\
      \ dawn. The Champion laid down her weapon and stepped forward within an arm's\
      \ length of the beast. The hart, sacred to Heliod and bathed in the god's own\
      \ light, bowed to the Champion, marking her as the Chosen of the Sun God.\r\n\
