  \ on another target creature you control.\r\n\r\nDaybound *(When this enters the\
  \ battlefield, if it's not day or night, this game becomes day for all players.\
  \ If a player casts no spells during their own turn, this game becomes night for\
  \ all players next turn during the untap step next turn. When it becomes night,\
  \ all permanents on the battlefield transform into their nightbound side if they\
  \ have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their\
  \ nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and\
  \ cannot be responded to.)*"
