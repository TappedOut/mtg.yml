  \ gets -1/-1 until end of turn. *(Then send this card on an Adventure in exile.\
  \ You may cast the creature portion from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast\
  \ Demonic Stench for [[symbol:B]] from anywhere that you have the permission to\
  \ cast it, then exile it on an adventure instead of putting it into your graveyard.\
  \ When you have not chosen to cast Demonic Stench and put it on the stack, this\
  \ card is treated only as Hezrou in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not\
  \ exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function identically to modal double faced\
  \ cards when regarding to the interactions of cards that look at them or attempt\
  \ to cast them.)*"
