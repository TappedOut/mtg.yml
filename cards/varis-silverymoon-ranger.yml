rules: "Reach, ward [[symbol:1]] *(Whenever this becomes the target of a spell or\
  \ ability an opponent controls, counter it unless that player pays [[symbol:1]].)*\r\
  \n\r\nWhenever you cast a creature or planeswalker spell, venture into the dungeon.\
  \ This ability triggers only once each turn. *(If you aren't venturing through a\
  \ dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside the game, put it\
  \ into the command zone and put a venture counter on the first room of that dungeon.\
  \ All effects of that room trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while you\
  \ have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next room downward of your\
  \ choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you have resolved the effects\
  \ of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the game. You can only\
  \ venture through one dungeon at a time.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever you complete a dungeon,\
  \ create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token."
