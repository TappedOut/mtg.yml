rules: Target opponent sacrifices a nontoken creature. If that creature had converted
  mana cost/mana value 2 or less, conjure a duplicate of it into your hand. That duplicate
  perpetually gains "You may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast
  this spell." *(Generate a copy of the card that is not a token. Perpetual effects
  that are given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards are in
  and what zone they move to.)*
