rules: Daybound  *(When this enters the battlefield, if it's not day or night, this
  game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during their own turn,
  this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step. When it
  becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their nightbound
  side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter
  on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack
  and cannot be responded to.)*
