rules: Whenever Fire Juggler becomes blocked, clash with an opponent. If you win,
  Fire Juggler deals 4 damage to each creature blocking it. (Each clashing player
  reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom.
  A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
