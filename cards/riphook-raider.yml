rules: "This can't be blocked by creatures with power 2 or less.\r\n\r\nNightbound\
  \ *(If a player casts two spells during their own turn, this game becomes day during\
  \ the untap step next turn. When it becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield\
  \ transform into their daybound side if they have one, and any new permanents that\
  \ enter the battlefield will enter on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming\
  \ day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
