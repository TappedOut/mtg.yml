rules: "Defender\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of combat on your turn, you may clash with\
  \ an opponent. If you win, Sentry Oak gets +2/+0 and loses defender until end of\
  \ turn. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts\
  \ that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher\
  \ converted mana cost.)"
