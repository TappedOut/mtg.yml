rules: "At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control gets\
  \ +1/+0 and gains haste until end of turn.\r\n\r\nDaybound *(When this enters the\
  \ battlefield, if it's not day or night, this game becomes day for all players.\
  \ If a player casts no spells during their own turn, this game becomes night for\
  \ all players next turn during the untap step. When it becomes night, all permanents\
  \ on the battlefield transform into their nightbound side if they have one, and\
  \ any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side\
  \ if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded\
  \ to.)*"
