rules: "When The Grand Calcutron enters the battlefield, each player's hand becomes\
  \ a program (an ordered row of revealed cards) \r\n\r\nPlayers can only play the\
  \ first card of their program. \r\n\r\nIf a card would be put into a player's hand\
  \ from anywhere, that player reveals it and places it anywhere within his or her\
  \ program instead. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each player's end step, if that player's\
  \ program has fewer then five cards, he or she draws cards equal to the difference."
