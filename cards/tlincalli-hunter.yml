  \ cast Tlincalli Hunter from exile if you sent it on an adventure.)*\r\n\r\n-----\r\

  \ target creature card from your graveyard. Until the end of your next turn, you\
  \ may cast that card. *(Then send this card on an Adventure in exile. You may cast\
  \ the creature portion from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Retrieve\
  \ Prey for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:G]] from anywhere that you have the permission to\
  \ cast it, then exile it on an adventure instead of putting it into your graveyard.\
  \ When you have not chosen to cast Retrieve Prey and put it on the stack, this card\
  \ is treated only as Tlincalli Hunter in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When\
  \ not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function identically to modal double\
  \ faced cards when regarding to the interactions of cards that look at them or attempt\
  \ to cast them.)*"
