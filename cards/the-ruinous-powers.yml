rules: At the beginning of your upkeep, choose an opponent at random. Exile the top
  card of that player's library. Until end of turn, you may play that card and you
  may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast it. When you cast a
  spell this way, its owner loses life equal to its converted mana cost/mana value.
