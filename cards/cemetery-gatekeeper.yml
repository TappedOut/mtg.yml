rules: "First strike\r\n\r\nWhen this enters the battlefield, exile a card from a\
  \ graveyard.\r\n\r\nWhenever a player plays a land or casts a spell, if it shares\
  \ a card type with the exiled card, this deals 2 damage to that player. *(This is\
  \ a linked ability, linked to the ability in the second paragraph on the card named\
  \ \"Cemetery Gatekeeper\". This only deals damage if the played card shares a card\
  \ type with the exiled card that was exiled via the ability in the second paragraph.)*"
