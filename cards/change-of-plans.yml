rules: Each of X target creatures you control connive. You may have any number of
  them phase out. *(To have a creature connive, draw a card, then discard a card.
  If you discarded a nonland card, put a +1/+1 counter on that creature. Treat phased
  out permanents and anything attached to them as though they don't exist until their
  controller's next turn.)*
