rules: CARDNAME deals X damage to each creature without flying and each planeswalker.
  If X is 10 or more, open the "Uncovered Cavern" plot booster. *(There is presently
  no such thing as an "Uncovered Cavern" plot booster. It's effectively like when
  [[Steamflogger Boss]] was first printed and there was no such thing as contraptions
  until Unstable.)*
