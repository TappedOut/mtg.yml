rules: Whenever a creature dies *(is put into the graveyard from the battlefield)*,
  its controller distributes a number of +1/+1 counters equal to its power among any
  number of target creatures they control. Whenever you roll a Chaos Symbol, each
  player exiles all creatures they control and creates X 1/1 green Saproling creature
  tokens, where X is the total power of the creatures exiled in this way. Then planeswalk.
