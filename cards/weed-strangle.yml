rules: Destroy target creature. Clash with an opponent. If you win, you gain life
  equal to that creature's toughness. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of
  his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his
  or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
