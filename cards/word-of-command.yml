rules: Look at target opponent's hand and choose a card from it. You control that
  player until Word of Command finishes resolving. The player plays that card if able.
  While doing so, the player can activate mana abilities only if they're from lands
  he or she controls and only if mana they produce is spent to activate other mana
  abilities of lands he or she controls and/or play that card. If the chosen card
  is cast as a spell, you control the player while that spell is resolving.
