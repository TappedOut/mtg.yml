rules: Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn. Clash with an opponent.
  If you win, creatures that player controls don't untap during the player's next
  untap step. <i>(Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library,
  then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a
  higher converted mana cost.)
