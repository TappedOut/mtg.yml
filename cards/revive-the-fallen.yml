rules: Return target creature card in a graveyard to its owner's hand. Clash with
  an opponent. If you win, return Revive the Fallen to its owner's hand. (Each clashing
  player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card on the top
  or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
