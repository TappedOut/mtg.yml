rules: Whenever one or more creatures you control attack, each defending player divides
  all creatures without flying he or she controls into a "left" pile and a "right"
  pile. Then, for each attacking creature you control, choose "left" or "right." That
  creature can't be blocked this combat except by flying creatures and creatures in
  a pile with the chosen label.
