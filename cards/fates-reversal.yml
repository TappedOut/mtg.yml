rules: Return up to one target creature card from your graveyard to your hand. Venture
  into the dungeon. *(If you aren't venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the
  dungeon cards you own from outside the game, put it into the command zone and put
  a venture counter on the first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger.
  When you venture into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command zone,
  advance to the next room downward of your choice and triggering all effects of that
  room. When you have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove
  that dungeon from the game. You can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*
