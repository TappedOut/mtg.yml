rules: "Companion &mdash; Your starting deck must contain only cards with odd converted\
  \ mana costs and land cards. *(You may reveal this card from outside the game before\
  \ you start and declare it as your companion. If you do, your deck must follow the\
  \ companion's restrictions. You may pay [[symbol:3]] to put this companion from\
  \ your sideboard to your hand at any time you could cast a sorcery. This action\
  \ can't be interacted with or countered. You may only choose one companion for your\
  \ deck before the start of each round.)*\r\n\r\nIf a source you control with an\
  \ odd converted mana cost would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double\
  \ that damage to that permanent or player instead."
