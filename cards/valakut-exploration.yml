rules: "*Landfall* &mdash; Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control,\
  \ exile the top card of your library. You may play that card as long as it remains\
  \ exiled.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of your end step, if there are cards exiled with\
  \ Valakut Exploration, put them into their owner's graveyard, then Valakut Exploration\
  \ deals that much damage to each opponent."
