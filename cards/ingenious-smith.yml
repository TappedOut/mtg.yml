rules: "When this enters the battlefield, look at the top four cards of your library.\
  \ You may reveal an artifact card from among them and put it into your hand. Put\
  \ the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.\r\n\r\nWhenever one\
  \ or more artifacts enter the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter\
  \ on this. This ability only triggers once each turn."
