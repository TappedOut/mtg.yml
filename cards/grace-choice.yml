rules: Target opponent sacrifices a nontoken creature. If that creature had converted
  mana cost/mana value 2 or less, conjure a duplicate of it into your hand. *(Generate
  a copy of the card that is not a token.)* That duplicate perpetually gains "You
  may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast this spell." *(Perpetual
  effects that are given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards
  are in and what zone they move to.)*
