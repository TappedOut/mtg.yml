rules: At the beginning of your end step, if a creature died this turn *(was put into
  the graveyard from the battlefield, tokens are put into the graveyard before they
  cease to exist)*, venture into the dungeon. *(If you aren't venturing through a
  dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside the game, put it into
  the command zone and put a venture counter on the first room of that dungeon. All
  effects of that room trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while you have a
  dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next room downward of your choice and
  triggering all effects of that room. When you have resolved the effects of the last
  room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the game. You can only venture through
  one dungeon at a time.)*
