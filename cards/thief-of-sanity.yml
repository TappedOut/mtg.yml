rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhenever this deals combat damage to a player, look at the top\
  \ three cards of that player's library, exile one of them face down, then put the\
  \ rest into their graveyard. You may look at and cast that card for as long as it\
  \ remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to\
  \ cast that spell."
