rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhenever Thief of Sanity deals combat damage to a player, look\
  \ at the top 3 cards of that player's library. Exile one of those cards face-down,\
  \ then put the rest into that player's graveyard. You may look at and cast that\
  \ card for as long as it remains exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were\
  \ mana of any colour to cast that spell."
