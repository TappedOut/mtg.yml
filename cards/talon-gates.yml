rules: Any time you could cast a sorcery, you may exile a nonland card from your hand
  with X time counters on it, where X is its converted mana cost. If the exiled card
  doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. Whenever you roll the Chaos Symbol, remove
  two time counters from each suspended card you own.
