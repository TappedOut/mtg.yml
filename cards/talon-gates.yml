rules: "Any time you could cast a sorcery, you may exile a nonland card from your\
  \ hand with X time counters on it, where X is its converted mana cost. If the exiled\
  \ card doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. *(Exile it with X time counters on\
  \ it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed,\
  \ cast it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it gains haste until\
  \ end of turn.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever you roll the Chaos Symbol, remove two time counters\
  \ from each suspended card you own."
