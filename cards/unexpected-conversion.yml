rules: Draw two cards. Then you may exile an instant or sorcery card from your hand.
  If you do, search your hand and library for any number of cards with the same name,
  exile them, then shuffle your library. Seek an instant or sorcery card for each
  card exiled from your hand this way. *(Grab a random instant or sorcery card from
  your library and put it into your hand. Do not actually look at your library nor
  shuffle it.)*
