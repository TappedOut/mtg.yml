rules: At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player chooses target player
  who controls more creatures than he or she does and is his or her opponent. The
  first player may reveal cards from the top of his or her library until he or she
  reveals a creature card. If he or she does, that player puts that card onto the
  battlefield and all other cards revealed this way into his or her graveyard.
