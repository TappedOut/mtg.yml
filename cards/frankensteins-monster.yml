rules: As Frankenstein's Monster enters the battlefield, remove X creature cards in
  your graveyard from the game. If you can't, put Frankenstein's Monster into its
  owner's graveyard instead of into play. For each creature card removed this way,
  Frankenstein's Monster enters the battlefield with a +2/+0, +1/+1, or +0/+2 counter.
