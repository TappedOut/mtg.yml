rules: "First strike\r\n\r\nWhen Rahilda, Wanted Cutthroat deals combat damage to\
  \ a player, exile a nonland card from their library at random. During any turn you\
  \ attacked with a Wolf or Werewolf, you may cast that card and you may spend mana\
  \ as though it were mana of any colour to cast that spell.\r\n\r\nDaybound *(When\
  \ this enters the battlefield, if it's not day or night, this game becomes day for\
  \ all players. If a player casts no spells during their own turn, this game becomes\
  \ night for all players next turn during the untap step next turn. When it becomes\
  \ night, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their nightbound side\
  \ if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter\
  \ on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the\
  \ stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
