rules: "Each nonland card in your hand without foretell has foretell. Its foretell\
  \ cost is equal to its mana cost reduced by [[symbol:2]]. *(During your turn, you\
  \ may pay [[symbol:2]] and exile it from your hand face down. Cast it on a later\
  \ turn for its foretell cost.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever you foretell a card, Dream Devourer\
  \ gets +2/+0 until end of turn."
