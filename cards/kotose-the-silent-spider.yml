  card from an opponent's graveyard. Search that player's graveyard, hand and library
  for any number of cards with the same name as that card and exile them. Then that
  player shuffles their library. For as long as you control this, you may play one
  fo the exiled cards, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour
  to cast it.
