    flavour_text: '*A Phyrexian "sleeper agent," Xantcha has developed an inviolate
      sense of self. This aberration earned her a death sentence, but she was rescued
      by Urza and joined his crusade. Her Phyrexian credo of "Waste not, want not"
      has helped Urza more than even he comprehends.*'
