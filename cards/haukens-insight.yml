rules: "At the beginning of your upkeep, exile the top card of your library face down.\
  \ You may look at that card for as long as it remains exiled.\r\n\r\nOnce during\
  \ each of your turns, you may play a land or cast a spell from the face down cards\
  \ exiled with this permanent without paying its mana cost. *(This is a linked ability,\
  \ linked to the ability in the first paragraph on the card named \"Hauken's Insight\"\
  \ and to the ability on the card named [[Jacob Hauken, Inspector]]. You may only\
  \ play lands or cast spells that were exiled by one of these abilities.)*"
