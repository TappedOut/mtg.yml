rules: "Put two 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature tokens onto the battlefield. Clash\
  \ with an opponent. If you win, those creatures gain deathtouch until end of turn.\
  \ (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that\
  \ card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted\
  \ mana cost. Creatures dealt damage by a creature with deathtouch are destroyed.\
  \ You can divide combat damage from a creature with deathtouch among any of the\
  \ creatures blocking or blocked by it.)\r\n"
