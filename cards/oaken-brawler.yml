rules: When Oaken Brawler enters the battlefield, clash with an opponent. If you win,
  put a +1/+1 counter on Oaken Brawler. (Each clashing player reveals the top card
  of his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if
  his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
