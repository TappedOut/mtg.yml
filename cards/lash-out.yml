rules: Lash Out deals 3 damage to target creature. Clash with an opponent. If you
  win, Lash Out deals 3 damage to that creature's controller. (Each clashing player
  reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom.
  A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
