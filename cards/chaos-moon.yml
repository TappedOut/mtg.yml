rules: At the beginning of each upkeep, count the number of permanents. If the number
  is odd, until end of turn, red creatures get +1/+1 and whenever a player taps a
  Mountain for mana, that player adds (Red) to his or her mana pool. If the number
  is even, until end of turn, red creatures get -1/-1 and if a player taps a Mountain
  for mana, that Mountain produces colorless mana instead of any other type.
