rules: At the beginning of your end step, exile up to one target creature card from
  your graveyard. If you do, seek a creature card with converted mana cost/mana value
  equal to that of the exiled card plus one. *(Grab a random card of the given criteria
  from your library and put it into your hand. Do not actually look at your library
  nor shuffle it.)* The seek'd card perpetually gains menace. *(That card permanently
  gets menace regardless of what zone the card is in and what zone it moves to.)*
