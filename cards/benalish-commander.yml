  \ and exile it with X time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove\
  \ a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.\
  \ It has haste until end of turn.)\r\n\r\nWhenever a time counter is removed from\
  \ Benalish Commander while it's exiled, create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token."
