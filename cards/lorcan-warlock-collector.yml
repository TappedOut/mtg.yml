rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhenever a creature card is put into an opponent's graveyard\
  \ from anywhere, you may pay life equal to its converted mana cost/mana value. If\
  \ you do, put it onto the battlefield under your control. It's a Warlock in addition\
  \ to its other types.\r\n\r\nIf a Warlock you control would die *(be put into the\
  \ graveyard from the battlefield)*, exile it instead."
