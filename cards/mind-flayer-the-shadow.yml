rules: "This isn't a creature unless you control three or more permanents you don't\
  \ own.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of your end step, exile the bottom card of each opponent's\
  \ library face down. For as long as those cards remain exiled, you may look at them,\
  \ and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast those spells."
