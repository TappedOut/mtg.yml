  \ beginning of combat on your turn, put two +1/+1 counters on each creature you\
  \ control.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two spells during their own turn,\
  \ this game becomes day during the untap step next turn. When it becomes day, all\
  \ permanents on the battlefield transform into their daybound side if they have\
  \ one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their daybound\
  \ side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and cannot be\
