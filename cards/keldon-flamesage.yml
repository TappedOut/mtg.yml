rules: "Enlist *(As this creature attacks, you may tap a nonattacking creature you\
  \ control without summoning sickness. When you do, add its power to this creature's\
  \ until end of turn.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever Keldon Flamesage attacks, look at the top\
  \ X cards of your library, where X is Keldon Flamesage's power. You may exile an\
  \ instant or sorcery card with converted mana cost/mana value X or less from among\
  \ them. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. You may cast\
  \ the exiled card without paying its mana cost."
