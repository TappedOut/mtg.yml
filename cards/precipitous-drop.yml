rules: "Enchant creature\r\n\r\nWhen this enters the battlefield, venture into the\
  \ dungeon. *(If you aren't venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon\
  \ cards you own from outside the game, put it into the command zone and put a venture\
  \ counter on the first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When\
  \ you venture into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance\
  \ to the next room downward of your choice and triggering all effects of that room.\
  \ When you have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove that\
  \ dungeon from the game. You can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*\r\
  \n\r\nEnchanted creature gets -2/-2. It gets -5/-5 instead as long as you've completed\
  \ a dungeon."
