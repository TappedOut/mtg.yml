rules: "Companion &mdash; Your starting deck must contain only cards with even converted\
  \ mana costs. *(You may reveal this card from outside the game before you start\
  \ and declare it as your companion. If you do, your deck must follow the companion's\
  \ restrictions. You may pay [[symbol:3]] to put this companion from your sideboard\
  \ to your hand at any time you could cast a sorcery. This action can't be interacted\
  \ with or countered. You may only choose one companion for your deck before the\
  \ start of each round.)*\r\n\r\nWhen Gyruda enters the battlefield, each player\
  \ puts the top four cards of their library into their graveyard. Put a creature\
  \ card with an even converted mana cost from among those cards onto the battlefield\
