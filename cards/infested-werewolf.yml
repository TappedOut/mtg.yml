  \ creature tokens.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two spells during their\
  \ own turn, this game becomes day next turn during the untap step. When it becomes\
  \ day, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their daybound side if they\
  \ have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their\
  \ daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and\
  \ cannot be responded to.)*"
