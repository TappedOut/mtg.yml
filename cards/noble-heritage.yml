rules: Commander creatures you own have "When this creature enters the battlefield
  and at the beginning of your upkeep, each player may put two +1/+1 counters on a
  creature they control. For each opponent who does, you gain protection from that
  player until your next turn." *((Remember the acronym <b>debt</b>.) You can't be
  <b>d</b>amaged, <b>e</b>nchanted, <b>e</b>quipped, <b>b</b>locked or <b>t</b>argeted
  by anything controlled or casted by that player. Anything controlled by that player
  attached to you immediately falls off.)*
