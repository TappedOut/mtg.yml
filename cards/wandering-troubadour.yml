rules: At the beginning of your end step, if you had a land enter the battlefield
  under your control this turn, venture into the dungeon. *(If you aren't venturing
  through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside the game,
  put it into the command zone and put a venture counter on the first room of that
  dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while
  you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next room downward of your
  choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you have resolved the effects
  of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the game. You can only
  venture through one dungeon at a time.)*
