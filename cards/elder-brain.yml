rules: "Menace\r\n\r\nWhenever this attacks a player, exile all cards from that player's\
  \ hand, then draw that many cards. You may play lands and cast spells from among\
  \ the exiled cards for as long as they remain exiled. If you cast a spell this way,\
  \ you may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast it. *(You may\
  \ only play cards from amongst those exiled via this ability.)*"
