rules: When you encounter Morphic Tide, each player shuffles all permanents he or
  she controls into his or her library, then reveals that many cards from the top
  of his or her library. Each player puts all artifact, creature, land and planeswalker
  cards revealed in this way onto the battlefield, then does the same for enchantment
  cards, then puts all cards revealed this way that weren't put onto the battlefield
  on the bottom of his or her library in any order. _(Then planeswalk away from this
  phenomenon.)_
