rules: When this enters the battlefield, look at the top X cards of your library,
  where X is your devotion to blue. Put up to one of them on top of your library and
  the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. If X is greater than or
  equal to the number of cards in your library, you win the game. *(Each [[symbol:U]]
  in the mana costs of permanents you control counts toward your devotion to blue.)*
