rules: When Thassa's Oracle enters the battlefield, look at the top X cards of your
  library, where X is your devotion to blue. Put up to one of them on top of your
  library and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order. If X is greater
  than or equal to the number of cards in your library, you win the game. *(Each [[symbol:U]]
  in the mana costs of permanents you control counts toward your devotion to blue.)*
