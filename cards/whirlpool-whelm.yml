rules: "Clash with an opponent, then return target creature to its owner's hand. If\
  \ you win, you may put that creature on top of its owner's library instead. (Each\
  \ clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card\
  \ on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted\
  \ mana cost.)\r\n"
