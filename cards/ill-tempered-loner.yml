  \ end of turn.\r\n\r\nDaybound *(When this enters the battlefield, if it's not day\
  \ or night, this game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during\
  \ their own turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap\
  \ step next turn. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform\
  \ into their nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter\
  \ the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming\
  \ day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
