rules: "You may pay [[symbol:3]][[symbol:G]] rather than pay this spell's mana cost.\r\
  \n\r\nSearch your library for up to four basic land cards and reveal them. Put two\
  \ of them onto the battlefield tapped under you control, and if the [[symbol:3]][[symbol:G]]\
  \ cost was paid, put one of them onto the battlefield tapped under an opponent's\
  \ control. Put the rest into your hand, then shuffle your library."
