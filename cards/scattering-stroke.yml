rules: Counter target spell. Clash with an opponent. If you win, at the beginning
  of your next main phase, you may add (X) to your mana pool, where X is that spell's
  converted mana cost. <i>(Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her
  library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card
  had a higher converted mana cost.)
