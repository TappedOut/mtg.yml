  *(You may cast Rob the Hoard for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:W]] from anywhere that you\

  \ it on the stack, this card is treated only as Crystal Dragon in whatever zone\
  \ it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function\
  \ identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of\
  \ cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
