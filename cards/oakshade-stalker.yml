rules: "You may cast this as though this spell had flash if you pay [[symbol:2]] more\
  \ to cast this.\r\n\r\nDaybound *(When this enters the battlefield, if it's not\
  \ day or night, this game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells\
  \ during their own turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during\
  \ the untap step next turn. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield\
  \ transform into their nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents\
  \ that enter the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one.\
  \ Becoming day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
