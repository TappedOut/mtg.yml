rules: Until end of turn, creatures you control gain menace and "Whenever this creature
  deals combat damage to a player, exile the top card of that player's library face
  down. You may look at and play that card for as long as it remains exiled, and you
  may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast that spell."
