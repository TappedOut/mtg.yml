rules: "You may tap three untapped Dwarves you control rather than pay this spell's\
  \ mana cost.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each end step, if a land you controlled\
  \ was put into your graveyard from the battlefield this turn, reveal the top four\
  \ cards of your library. Put any number of Dwarf cards from among them into your\
  \ hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order."
