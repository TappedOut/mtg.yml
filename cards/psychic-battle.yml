rules: Whenever a player chooses one or more targets, each player reveals the top
  card of his or her library. The player who reveals the card with the highest converted
  mana cost may change the target or targets. If two or more cards are tied for highest
  cost, the target or targets remain unchanged. Changing targets this way doesn't
  trigger this ability.
