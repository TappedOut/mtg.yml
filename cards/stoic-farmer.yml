rules: "When Stoic Farmer enters the battlefield, search your library for a basic\
  \ Plains card and reveal it. If an opponent controls more lands than you, put it\
  \ onto the battlefield tapped. Otherwise put it into your hand. Then shuffle your\
  \ library.\r\n\r\nForetell [[symbol:1]][[symbol:W]] *(During your turn, you may\
  \ pay [[symbol:2]] and exile this card from your hand face down. Cast it on a later\
  \ turn for its foretell cost.)*"
