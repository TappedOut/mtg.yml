    flavour_text: '*Ashnod served as Mishra''s confidante while he led Fallaji weapons
      development before the Brothers'' War. Whereas Mishra works in metals and stone,
      however, Ashnod works in living flesh. She sees all living things as prototype
      machines; her "improvements" to them make her as feared by allies as by enemies.*'
