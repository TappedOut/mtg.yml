rules: Whenever Nascent Metamorph attacks or blocks, target opponent reveals cards
  from the top of their library until they reveal a creature card. Nascent Metamorph
  becomes a copy of that card until end of turn. Then that player puts all cards revealed
  this way on the bottom of their library in a random order.
