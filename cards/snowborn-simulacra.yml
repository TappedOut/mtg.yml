rules: Conjure a duplicate of each of X target nontoken permanents into your hand.
  Those cards perpetually gain "You may spend mana as though it were mana of any colour
  to cast this spell." If X is 5 or more, you may put one of them from your hand onto
  the battlefield. *(Generate a copy of the card that is not a token.)*
