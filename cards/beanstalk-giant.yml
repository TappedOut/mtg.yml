rules: "Beanstalk Giant's power and toughness are each equal to the number of lands\
  \ you control.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Beanstalk Giant from exile if you\
  \ sent it on an adventure.)*\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<h3>Fertile Footsteps</h3>\r\n\
  <h4>Sorcery &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\r\nSearch your library for a basic land card,\
  \ put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You\
  \ may cast Fertile Footsteps for [[symbol:2]][[symbol:G]] from anywhere that you\
  \ have the permission to cast this, then exile it on an adventure instead of putting\
  \ it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Fertile Footsteps, this\
  \ card is treated only as Beanstalk Giant in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(Example\
  \ scenarios for Fertile Footsteps| You may cast this off of [[Melek, Izzet Paragon]].\
  \ You may not target this with [[Snapcaster Mage]]. [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]]\
  \ increases the cost of this. [[Electrodominance]] requires X=3. If your opponent\
  \ owns this and you cast it, you may cast their Beanstalk Giant from exile. You\
  \ can cast this from a cascade spell if the spell has a cost greater than Beanstalk\
  \ Giant's cost.)*"
