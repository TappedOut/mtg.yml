rules: "This attacks each combat if able.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two\
  \ spells during their own turn, this game becomes day next turn during the untap\
  \ step. When it becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their\
  \ daybound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield\
  \ will enter on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not\
  \ use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
