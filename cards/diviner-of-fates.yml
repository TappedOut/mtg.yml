rules: "When Diviner of Fates enters the battlefield, it connives. *(Draw a card,\
  \ then discard a card. If you discarded a nonland card, put a +1/+1 counter on this\
  \ creature.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever you discard one or more cards, seek a card that shares\
  \ a card type with one of the discarded cards. This ability triggers only once each\
  \ turn. *(Grab a random card of the given criteria from your library and put it\
  \ into your hand. Do not actually look at your library nor shuffle it.)*"
