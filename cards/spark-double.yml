rules: You may have Spark Double enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature or
  planeswalker you control, except it enters with an additional +1/+1 counter on it
  if it's a creature, or an additional loyalty counter on it if it's a planeswalker,
  and it isn't legendary if that permanent is legendary.
