rules: "Whenever this enters the battlefield or [[Howlpack Piper]] transforms into\
  \ this, look at the top six cards of your library. You may reveal a creature card\
  \ from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your\
  \ library in a random order.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two spells during\
  \ their own turn, this game becomes day during the untap step next turn. When it\
  \ becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their daybound side\
  \ if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter\
  \ on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack\
  \ and cannot be responded to.)*"
