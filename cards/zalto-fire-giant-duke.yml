  \ you aren't venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own\
  \ from outside the game, put it into the command zone and put a venture counter\
  \ on the first room of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you\
  \ venture into the dungeon while you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance\
  \ to the next room downward of your choice and triggering all effects of that room.\
  \ When you have resolved the effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove that\
  \ dungeon from the game. You can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*"
