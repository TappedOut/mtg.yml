rules: "When Colossal Badger enters the battlefield, you gain 3 life.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\
  \n\r\n*(You may cast Colossal Badger from exile if you sent it on an adventure.)*\r\
  \n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<h3>Dig Deep</h3>\r\n<h4>Sorcery &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\r\
  \nChoose target creature. Mill four cards, then put a +1/+1 counter on that creature\
  \ for each creature card milled this way. *(Then send this card on an Adventure\
  \ in exile. You may cast the creature portion from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\
  *(You may cast Dig Deep for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:G]] from anywhere that you have\
  \ the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure instead of putting it\
  \ into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Dig Deep and put it on the\
  \ stack, this card is treated only as Colossal Badger in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\
  \n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function identically to\
  \ modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of cards that look\
  \ at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
