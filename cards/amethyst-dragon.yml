  \n<h4>Sorcery &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\r\nExplosive Crystal deals 4 damage divided\
  \ as you choose among any number of targets *(creature, player or planeswalker)*.\r\
  \n\r\n *(Then send this card on an Adventure in exile. You may cast the creature\
  \ from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Explosive Crystal for [[symbol:4]][[symbol:R]]\
  \ from anywhere that you have the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure\
  \ instead of putting it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Explosive\
  \ Crystal and put it on the stack, this card is treated only as Amethyst Dragon\
  \ in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure\
  \ cards function identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions\
  \ of cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
