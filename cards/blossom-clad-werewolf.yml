  \ casts two spells during their own turn, this game becomes day next turn during\
  \ the untap step. When it becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield transform\
  \ into their daybound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the\
  \ battlefield will enter on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night\
  \ does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
