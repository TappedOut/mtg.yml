rules: Whenever Surtland Flinger attacks, you may sacrifice another creature. When
  you do, Surtland Flinger deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature's power to
  target creature, player or planeswalker. If the sacrificed creature was a Giant,
  Surtland Flinger deals twice that much damage instead.
