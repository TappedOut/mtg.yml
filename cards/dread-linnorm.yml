rules: "Dread Linnorm can't be blocked by creatures with power 3 or less.\r\n\r\n\
  <br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Dread Linnorm from exile if you sent it on an adventure.)*\r\
  \n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<h3>Scale Deflection</h3>\r\n<h4>Instant &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\
  \n\r\nPut two +1/+1 counters on target creature and untap it. It gains hexproof\
  \ until end of turn. *(Then send this card on an Adventure in exile. You may cast\
  \ the creature from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Scale Deflection\
  \ for [[symbol:3]][[symbol:G]] from anywhere that you have the permission to cast\
  \ it, then exile it on an adventure instead of putting it into your graveyard. When\
  \ you have not chosen to cast Scale Deflection and put it on the stack, this card\
  \ is treated only as Dread Linnorm in whatever zone it is in.)*"
