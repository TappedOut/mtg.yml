rules: "When Sea Hag enters the battlefield, creatures your opponents control get\
  \ -4/-0 until end of turn.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Sea Hag from exile\
  \ if you sent it on an adventure.)*\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<h3>Aquatic Ingress</h3>\r\
  \n<h4>Instant &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\r\nUp to two target creatures each get\
  \ +1/+0 until end of turn and can't be blocked this turn. *(Then send this card\
  \ on an Adventure in exile. You may cast the creature from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\
  \n\r\n*(You may cast Aquatic Ingress for [[symbol:2]][[symbol:U]] from anywhere\
  \ that you have the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure instead\
  \ of putting it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Aquatic Ingress\
  \ and put it on the stack, this card is treated only as Sea Hag in whatever zone\
  \ it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function\
  \ identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of\
  \ cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
