rules: Whenever you cast a spell, you may put it on the bottom of its owner's library.
  If you do, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland
  card. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then put the rest on
  the bottom of your library in a random order. This ability triggers only once each
  turn.
