rules: When this enters the battlefield, conjure a duplicate of a random creature
  card from your opponent's library into your hand *(generate a copy of that creature
  that is not a token and put it into your hand)*. It perpetually gains "You may spend
  mana as though it were mana of any colour to cast this spell." *(Perpetual effects
  are given to cards permanently regardless of what zone those cards are in and what
  zone they move to.)*
