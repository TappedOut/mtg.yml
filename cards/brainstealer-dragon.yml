rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of your end step, exile the top card of each\
  \ opponent's library. You may play those cards for as long as they remain exiled.\
  \ If you cast a spell this way, you may spend mana as though it were mana of any\
  \ colour to cast it.\r\n\r\nWhenever a nonland permanent an opponent owns enters\
  \ the battlefield under your control, they lose life equal to its converted mana\
  \ cost/mana value."
