rules: "Whenever a permanent you control is dealt damage, this deals that much damage\
  \ to target creature, player or planeswalker.\r\n\r\n[[symbol:1]][[symbol:R]]: This\
  \ gets +2/+0 until end of turn.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two spells\
  \ during their own turn, this game becomes day during the untap step next turn.\
  \ When it becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their daybound\
  \ side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will\
  \ enter on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use\
  \ the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
