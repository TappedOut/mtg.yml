  \ game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during their own\
  \ turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step\
  \ next turn. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform\

  \ the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming\
