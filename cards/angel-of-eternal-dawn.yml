rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhen this enters the battlefield, the game becomes day. *(This\
  \ game becomes day for all players. If a player casts no spells during their own\
  \ turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step\
  \ next turn. When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform\
  \ into their nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter\
  \ the battlefield will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming\
  \ day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*\r\n\r\nThis game\
  \ can't become night.\r\n\r\nYour opponent can't cast spells with converted mana\
  \ cost/mana value greater than the number of turns they have begun."
