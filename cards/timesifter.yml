rules: At the beginning of each upkeep, each player removes the top card of his or
  her library from the game. The player who removed the card with the highest converted
  mana cost takes an extra turn after this one. If two or more players' cards are
  tied for highest cost, the tied players repeat this process until the tie is broken.
