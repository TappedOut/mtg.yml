rules: Target creature you control gains protection from the color of your choice
  until end of turn. Clash with an opponent. If you win, return Redeem the Lost to
  its owner's hand. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library,
  then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a
  higher converted mana cost.)
