rules: Each player secretly chooses a number 0 or greater, then all players reveal
  those numbers simultaneously and determine the highest and lowest numbers revealed
  this way. Wheel of Misfortune deals damage equal to the highest number to each player
  who chose that number. Each player who didn't choose the lowest number discards
  their hand, then draws seven cards.
