rules: "Instant and Sorcery spells have rebound. *(The spell's controller exiles the\

  \ player's next upkeep, they may cast that card from exile without paying its mana\
  \ cost.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever you roll a Chaos Symbol, you may search your library for\
  \ an instant or sorcery card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your\
  \ library."
