rules: "When Spara's Bodyguard enters the battlefield, you may choose a creature card\
  \ in your hand. If you do, it perpetually gains \"This creature enters the battlefield\
  \ with an additional shield counter on it.\" Otherwise, put a shield counter on\
  \ Spara's Bodyguard. *(The next time it would be dealt damage or destroyed, it isn't.\
  \ Instead, remove a shield counter from it.)*\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each combat,\
  \ Spara's Bodyguard gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each shield counter among other\
  \ creatures you control."
