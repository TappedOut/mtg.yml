rules: Players play a subgame starting at 5 life and with up to three permanent cards
  with different names from their main-game library on the battlefield. As the subgame
  ends, the winner chooses one of the cards they put onto the battlefield as the subgame
  began and puts it onto the battlefield rather than shuffling it into their library.
