rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nWhen Moonshae Pixie enters the battlefield, draw cards equal\
  \ to the number of opponents who were dealt combat damage this turn.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\
  \n\r\n*(You may cast Moonshae Pixie from exile if you sent it on an adventure.)*\r\
  \n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<h3>Pixie Dust</h3>\r\n<h4>Instant &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\
  \r\nUp to three target creatures gain flying until end of turn. *(Then send this\
  \ card on an Adventure in exile. You may cast the creature from exile.)*\r\n\r\n\
  <br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Pixie Dust for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:U]] from anywhere\
  \ that you have the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure instead\
  \ of putting it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Pixie Dust\
  \ and put it on the stack, this card is treated only as Moonshae Pixie in whatever\
  \ zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function\
  \ identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of\
  \ cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
