  <br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Pixie Dust for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:U]] from anywhere\
  \ that you have the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure instead\
  \ of putting it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Pixie Dust\
  \ and put it on the stack, this card is treated only as Moonshae Pixie in whatever\
  \ zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function\
  \ identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of\
  \ cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
