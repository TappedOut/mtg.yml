rules: Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. Clash with an opponent. If you
  win, that creature gets an additional +2/+2 and gains trample until end of turn.
  (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that
  card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted
  mana cost.)
