rarity: common
rules: Counter target spell unless its controller pays {{X}}. Clash with an opponent.
  If you win, that spell's controller puts the top four cards of his or her library
  into his or her graveyard. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or
  her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her
  card had a higher converted mana cost.)
