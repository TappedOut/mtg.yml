rules: Counter target spell. If the spell is countered this way, remove it from the
  game with three time counters on it instead of putting it into its owner's graveyard.
  If it doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. *(At the beginning of its owner's
  upkeep, remove a counter from that card. When the last is removed, the player casts
  it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it has haste.)*
