rules: When this enters the battlefield, venture into the dungeon. *(If you aren't
  venturing through a dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside
  the game, put it into the command zone and put a venture counter on the first room
  of that dungeon. All effects of that room trigger. When you venture into the dungeon
  while you have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next room downward
  of your choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you have resolved the
  effects of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the game. You
  can only venture through one dungeon at a time.)*
