rules: "First strike, haste\r\n\r\nWhen Karlach, Tiefling Berserker specializes into\
  \ this creature from your graveyard, return it from your graveyard to the battlefield.\
  \ It perpetually gains \"this creature can't block.\" *(Perpetual effects that are\
  \ given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards are in and what\
  \ zone they move to.)*\r\n \r\nWhen this card specializes from any zone, seek an\
  \ instant or sorcery card with converted mana cost/mana value 3 or less. Until end\
  \ of turn, you may cast that card without paying its mana cost. *(Grab a random\
  \ card of the given criteria from your library and put it into your hand. Do not\
  \ actually look at your library nor shuffle it.)*"
