rules: "*Sumo Spirit* &mdash; As long as it's your turn, each creature assigns combat\
  \ damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.\r\n\r\n*Hundred Hand Slap*\
  \ &mdash; Whenever this attacks, up to one hundred target creatures each get +0/+X\
  \ until end of turn, where X is the number of cards in your hand."
