  \n*(You may cast Rescue the Foal for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:W]] from anywhere that\

  \ it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function\
  \ identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of\
  \ cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
