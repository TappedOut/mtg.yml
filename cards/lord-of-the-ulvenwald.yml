rules: "Other Wolves and Werewolves you control get +1/+1.\r\n\r\nWhenever this attacks,\
  \ add [[symbol:R]] or [[symbol:G]]. Until end of turn, you don't lose this mana\
  \ as steps and phases end.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two spells during\
  \ their own turn, this game becomes day next turn during the untap step. When it\
  \ becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their daybound side\
  \ if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter\
  \ on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack\
  \ and cannot be responded to.)*"
