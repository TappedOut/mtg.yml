rules: Whenever Pygmy Hippo attacks and isn't blocked, you may have defending player
  play a mana ability of each land he or she controls and empty his or her mana pool.
  If you do, Pygmy Hippo deals no combat damage this turn and at the beginning of
  your postcombat main phase, you add (X) to your mana pool, where X is equal to the
  amount of mana emptied from defending player's mana pool this way.
