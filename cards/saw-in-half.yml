rules: Destroy target creature. If that creature dies this way *(would be put into
  the graveyard from the battlefield, tokens are put into the graveyard before ceasing
  to exist)*, its controller creates two tokens that are copies of that creature,
  except their base power and toughness are half that creature's power and toughness
  respectively. Round up each time.
