  \ portion from exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Capsizing Wave for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:U]]\
  \ from anywhere that you have the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure\
  \ instead of putting it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Capsizing\
  \ Wave and put it on the stack, this card is treated only as Sword Coast Serpent\
  \ in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure\
  \ cards function identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions\
  \ of cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
