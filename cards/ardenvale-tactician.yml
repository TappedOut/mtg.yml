  \ this card is treated only as Ardenvale Tactician in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\
  \n\r\n*(Example scenarios for Dizzying Swoo; You may cast this off of [[Melek, Izzet\
  \ Paragon]]. You may not target this with [[Snapcaster Mage]]. [[Thalia, Guardian\
  \ of Thraben]] increases the cost of this. [[Electrodominance]] requires X=2. You\
  \ may cast this from a cascade spell if the spell has a cost greater than Ardenvale\
  \ Tactician's cost. If you cast a Dizzying Swoop that another player owns, only\
  \ you may cast the Ardenvale Tactician that got sent on an adventure, not the owner.)*"
