  <h4>Instant &mdash; Adventure</h4>\r\n\r\nTap up to two target creatures.\r\n\r\n\
  <br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Dizzying Swoop for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:W]] from anywhere\
  \ that you have the permission to cast this, then exile it on an adventure instead\
  \ of putting it into your graveyard. When you have not chosen to cast Dizzying Swoop,\
  \ this card is treated only as Ardenvale Tactician in whatever zone it is in.)*\r\
  \n\r\n*(Example scenarios for Dizzying Swoo; You may cast this off of [[Melek, Izzet\
  \ Paragon]]. You may not target this with [[Snapcaster Mage]]. [[Thalia, Guardian\
  \ of Thraben]] increases the cost of this. [[Electrodominance]] requires X=2. You\
  \ may cast this from a cascade spell if the spell has a cost greater than Ardenvale\
  \ Tactician's cost. If you cast a Dizzying Swoop that another player owns, only\
  \ you may cast the Ardenvale Tactician that got sent on an adventure, not the owner.)*"
