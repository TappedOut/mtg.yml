rules: "All creatures able to block Nath's Elite do so.\r\n\r\nWhen Nath's Elite enters\
  \ the battlefield, clash with an opponent. If you win, put a +1/+1 counter on Nath's\
  \ Elite. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then\
  \ puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher\
  \ converted mana cost.)"
