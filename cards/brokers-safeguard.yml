rules: Exile target nonartifact creature you control. It perpetually gains "This creature
  enters the battlefield with an additional shield counter on it." Then return that
  card to the battlefield under its owner's control. *(The next time it would be dealt
  damage or destroyed, it isn't. Instead, remove a shield counter from it. Perpetual
  effects that are given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards
  are in and what zone they move to.)*
