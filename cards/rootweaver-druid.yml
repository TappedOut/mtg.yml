rules: When Rootweaver Druid enters the battlefield, each opponent may search their
  library for up to three basic land cards. They each put one of those cards onto
  the battlefield tapped under your control and the rest onto the battlefield tapped
  under their control. Then each player who searched their library this way shuffles
  it.
