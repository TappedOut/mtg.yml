  \ turn, this game becomes night for all players next turn during the untap step.\
  \ When it becomes night, all permanents on the battlefield transform into their\
  \ nightbound side if they have one, and any new permanents that enter the battlefield\
  \ will enter on their nightbound side if they have one. Becoming day/night does\
