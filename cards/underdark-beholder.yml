rules: "CARDNAME enters the battlefield with ten eyestalk counters on it.\r\n\r\n\
  If CARDNAME would be dealt damage, remove that many eyestalk counters form it instead.\
  \ If you can't, sacrifice it.\r\n\r\nWhenever CARDNAME attacks, reveal cards from\
  \ the top of your library until you reveal an instant, sorcery, or enchantment card\
  \ with converted mana cost less than the  number of eyestalk counters on CARDNAME.\
  \ You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Shuffle your library.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\
