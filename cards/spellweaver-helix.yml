  \ target sorcery cards in a single graveyard from the game. (The removed cards are\
  \ imprinted on this artifact.) \r\n\r\nWhenever a card is played, if it has the\
  \ same name as one of the imprinted sorcery cards, you may copy the other. If you\
  \ do, you may play the copy without paying its mana cost."
