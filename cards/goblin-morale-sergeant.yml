rules: "Haste\r\n\r\nEnlist *(As this creature attacks, you may tap a nonattacking\
  \ creature you control without summoning sickness. When you do, add its power to\
  \ this creature's until end of turn.)*\r\n\r\nWhenever Goblin Morale Sergeant enlists\
  \ a nontoken creature, you may conjure a duplicate of that creature into the top\
  \ five cards of your library at random. The duplicate perpetually gets +1/+0 and\
  \ gains haste. *(Generate a copy of the card that is not a token. Perpetual effects\
  \ that are given to cards are permanent regardless of what zone those cards are\
  \ in and what zone they move to.)*"
