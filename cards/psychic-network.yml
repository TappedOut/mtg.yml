rules: Each player reveals the top card of his or her library to all other players
  by continuously holding it against his or her forehead. This does not allow a player
  to look at his or her own card. (That card still counts as the top card of your
  library. Whenever you draw a card, draw that one and replace it with the next card
  of your library.)
