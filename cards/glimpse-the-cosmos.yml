rules: "Look at the top three cards of your library. Put on of them into your hand\
  \ and the rest on the bottom of your library an any order.\r\n\r\nAs long as you\
  \ control a giant, you may cast Glimpse the Cosmos from your graveyard by paying\
  \ [[symbol:U]] rather than paying its mana cost. If you cast Glimpse the Cosmos\
  \ this way it would be put into your graveyard, exile it instead."
