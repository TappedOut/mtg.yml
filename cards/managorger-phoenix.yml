rules: "Flying\r\n\r\nThis can't block.\r\n\r\nWhenever you cast a spell, if this\
  \ is in your graveyard, put a flame counter on this for each [[symbol:R]] in that\
  \ spell's mana cost. If this has five or more flame counters on this, return this\
  \ to the battlefield and this perpetually gets +1/+1. *(This permanently gets +1/+1\
  \ regardless of what zone this is in and what zone this moves to.)*"
