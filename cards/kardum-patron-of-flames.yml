rules: "Haste\r\n\r\nWhenever Kardum, Patron of Flames attacks, put a flame counter\
  \ on it, then seek a card with converted mana cost/mana value equal to the number\
  \ of flame counters on it and exile that card face down.\r\n\r\nWhen Kardum dies,\
  \ put all cards you own exiled with it into your hand. At the beginning of the end\
  \ step of your next turn, discard those cards. *(This is a linked ability, linked\
  \ to the ability in the first paragraph on this card. Cards you own exiled by this\
  \ card only get put into your hand if those exiled cards were exiled by the ability\
  \ in the first paragraph.)*"
