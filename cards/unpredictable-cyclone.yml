rules: "If a cycling ability of another nonland card would cause you to draw a card,\
  \ instead exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a card that shares\
  \ a card type with the cycled card. You may cast that card without paying its mana\
  \ cost. Then put the exiled cards that weren't cast this way on the bottom of your\
  \ library in a random order.\r\n\r\nCycling [[symbol:2]] ([[symbol:2]], Discard\
