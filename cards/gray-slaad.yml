  \ exile.)*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n*(You may cast Entropic Decay for [[symbol:1]][[symbol:B]]\
  \ from anywhere that you have the permission to cast it, then exile it on an adventure\

  \ Decay and put it on the stack, this card is treated only as Gray Slaad in whatever\
  \ zone it is in.)*\r\n\r\n*(When not exiled on an adventure, Adventure cards function\
  \ identically to modal double faced cards when regarding to the interactions of\
  \ cards that look at them or attempt to cast them.)*"
