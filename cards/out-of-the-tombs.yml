rules: "At the beginning of your upkeep, put two eon counters on Out of the Tombs,\
  \ then mill cards equal to the number of eon counters on it. *(To mill a card, put\
  \ the top card of your library into your graveyard.)*\r\n\r\nIf you would draw a\
  \ card while your library has no cards in it, instead return a creature card from\
  \ your graveyard to the battlefield. If you can't, you lose the game."
