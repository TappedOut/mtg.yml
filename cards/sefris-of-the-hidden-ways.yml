rules: "Whenever a creature card enters your graveyard, venture into the dungeon.\
  \ This ability triggers only once each turn. *(If you aren't venturing through a\
  \ dungeon, choose one of the dungeon cards you own from outside the game, put it\
  \ into the command zone and put a venture counter on the first room of that dungeon.\
  \ All effects of that room trigger. When you venture into the dungeon while you\
  \ have a dungeon in the command zone, advance to the next room downward of your\
  \ choice and triggering all effects of that room. When you have resolved the effects\
  \ of the last room of the dungeon, remove that dungeon from the game. You can only\
  \ venture through one dungeon at a time.)*\r\n\r\n*Create Undead* \u2014 Whenever\
  \ you complete a dungeon, return target creature card from your graveyard to the\
