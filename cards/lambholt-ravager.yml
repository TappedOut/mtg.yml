rules: "Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this deals 2 damage to each opponent.\r\
  \n\r\nNightbound *(If a player casts two spells during their own turn, this game\
  \ becomes day during the untap step next turn. When it becomes day, all permanents\
  \ on the battlefield transform into their daybound side if they have one, and any\
  \ new permanents that enter the battlefield will enter on their daybound side if\
  \ they have one. Becoming day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded\
  \ to.)*"
