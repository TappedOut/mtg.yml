rules: "Companion &mdash; Each nonland card in your starting deck must share exactly\
  \ one card type across all of them. *(You may reveal this card from outside the\
  \ game before you start and declare it as your companion. If you do, your deck must\
  \ follow the companion's restrictions. You may pay [[symbol:3]] to put this companion\
  \ from your sideboard to your hand at any time you could cast a sorcery. This action\
  \ can't be interacted with or countered. You may only choose one companion for your\
  \ deck before the start of each round.)*\r\n\r\nAs Umori, the Collector enters the\
  \ battlefield, choose a card type.\r\n\r\nSpells you cast of the chosen type cost\
  \ [[symbol:1]] less to cast."
