  \ controller, put a -0/-1 counter on that creature.\r\n\r\nWhen enchanted creature\
  \ is put into a graveyard, that creature's controller chooses a creature that Takklemaggot\
  \ could enchant. If he or she does, return Takklemaggot to the battlefield under\
  \ your control attached to that creature. If he or she doesn't, return Takklemaggot\
