rules: "If a nontoken creature an opponent controls would dies *(be put into the graveyard\
  \ from the battlefield)*, exile that card with an ice counter on it instead.\r\n\
  \r\nYou may cast spells from among cards in exile your opponents own with ice counters\
  \ on them, and you may spend mana from snow sources as though it were mana of any\
  \ colour to cast those spells."
