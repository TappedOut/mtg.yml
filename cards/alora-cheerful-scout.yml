rules: Whenever you attack, up to one target attacking creature can't be blocked this
  turn. At the beginning of the next end step, return that creature to its owner's
  hand. If you do, it perpetually gets +1/+1. *(That card permanently gets X regardless
  of what zone the card is in and what zone it moves to.)*
