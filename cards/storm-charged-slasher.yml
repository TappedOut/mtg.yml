rules: "At the beginning of combat on your turn, target creature you control gets\
  \ +2/+0 and gains trample and haste until end of turn.\r\n\r\nNightbound *(If a\
  \ player casts two spells during their own turn, this game becomes day next turn\
  \ during the untap step. When it becomes day, all permanents on the battlefield\
  \ transform into their daybound side if they have one, and any new permanents that\
  \ enter the battlefield will enter on their daybound side if they have one. Becoming\
  \ day/night does not use the stack and cannot be responded to.)*"
