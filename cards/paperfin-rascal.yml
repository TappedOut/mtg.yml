rules: When Paperfin Rascal enters the battlefield, clash with an opponent. If you
  win, put a +1/+1 counter on Paperfin Rascal. (Each clashing player reveals the top
  card of his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins
  if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
