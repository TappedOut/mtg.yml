rules: Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a land card. Put
  that card into play and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order. Clash
  with an opponent. If you win, return Recross the Paths to its owner's hand. (Each
  clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card
  on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana
  cost.)
